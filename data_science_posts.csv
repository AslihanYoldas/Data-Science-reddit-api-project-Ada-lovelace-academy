t3_18qtaid,Probability reference book for data science professionals,19,50,HStuart18,t2_xfx8ms4,0,self.datascience,"Hi all, I'd like to rehash my understanding of the fundamentals of probability theory. I'm trying to find a probability book that meets the following criteria:Motivates different concepts and does not just show definition-proof-definition-proofI skimmed across Probability by Shiryaev but it was a bit too definition-proof for my liking and too abstract. I am looking for a dedicated probability book and will then move to a dedicated statistics reference book. Cheers"

t3_18q5xz2,"Should I work over Christmas to fix my code, or is it ok to leave it and delay a project by a couple of weeks?",47,48,ManagementObvious631,t2_9rp766xc1,0,self.datascience,"Edit: changed a date.It's a long story, but basically I started a new role (3 months in) and my code is giving incorrect results in a in-production model meaning the next inference run will be delayed a couple of weeks. I feel a responsibility for my code and I did unit test it in the training environment but it gives incorrect results in the production environment.Should I work over my Christmas break to fix it, so the project stays on track, or is it ok for me to have the opinion that the process and project plan should allow time for changes to have issues in the production environment and that the three hours I was given to get the code running wasn't enough and that's not necessarily my fault.If I don't fix it by the 28th of Dec the Dev who runs the spark jobs in on holiday for a couple of weeks so the inference will be delayed. I'm due back to work on Jan 3rd.What would you do?"

t3_18q5qym,"MS statisticians here, do you guys have good careers? Do you feel not having a PhD has held you back?",108,107,Direct-Touch469,t2_uy28jztl,0,self.datascience,Had a long chat with a relative who was trying to sell me on why taking a data scientist job after my MS is a waste of time and instead I need to delay gratification for a better career by doing a PhD in statistics. I was told I‚Äôd regret not doing one and that with an MS I will stagnate in pay and in my career mobility with an MS in Stats and not a PhD. So I wanna ask MS statisticians here who didn‚Äôt do a PhD. How did your career turn out? How are you financially? Can you enjoy nice things in life and do you feel you are ‚Äústuck‚Äù? Without a PhD has your career really been held back?

t3_18ponyx,MBA with Data Analytics Concentration after MS in Data Science?,25,0,livingwithnostalgia,t2_lpb6f4wr,0,self.datascience,"I have an MS in data science, working as a data analyst and considering getting an MBA. I'm not sure if I should do the concentration in data analytics or business analytics I see some programs offer. My MS program was focused on computer science and statistics courses, not really presenting or dealing with a client.Has anyone gone through a similar MS and done a data/business analytics focused MBA? Were the data classes helpful or do you feel a general MBA would have been better? Thanks.Edit: My employer offers tuition reimbursement but it's not much. Only $1,500 per term with a max of $3,000 a year. So I'll be paying some out of my own pocket."

t3_18p8uz5,Why can't I transform a distribution by deducting one from all counts?,23,49,wanderingcatto,t2_amc46yj2,0,self.datascience,"Suppose I have records of the number of fishes that each fisherman caught from a particular lake within the year. The distribution peaks at count = 1 (i.e. most fishermen caught just one fish from the lake in the year), tapers off after that, and has a long right-tail (a very small number of fishermen caught over 100 fishes).Such a data could possibly fit either a Poisson Distribution or a Negative Binomial Distribution. However, both of these distributions have a non-zero probability at count = 0, whereas for our data, fishermen who caught no fishes were not captured as a data point.Why is it not correct to transform our original data by just deducting 1 from all counts, and therefore shifting our distribution to the left by 1 such that there is now a non-zero probability at count = 0?(Context: this question came up to me during an interview for a data science job. The interviewer asked me how to deal with the non-zero probability at count = 0 for poisson or negative binomial distribution, and I suggested transforming the data by deducting 1 from all counts which apparently was wrong. I think the correct answer to how to deal with the absence of count = 0 is to use a zero-trauncated distribution instead)"

t3_18ns3lu,Thank you for the advice on my manager! I‚Äôm finally switching teams!,5,33,Much-Focus-1408,t2_6lukipdd,0,self.datascience,"I‚Äôve written a couple of times about my manager and how toxic it has been on the team. I had a chance to re-org to a different team, but he made it difficult to change and kept putting so many hoops.And then he became interim AVP because AVP got fed up and left, which meant that I wasn‚Äôt switching teams.However, I had a random chance meeting with the someone higher and I spoke to them about everything, which he wasn‚Äôt aware of. They have a brand new team that I‚Äôll be a part of.And best of all, my current manager can‚Äôt say anything and I‚Äôll be leaving! However, since it‚Äôs internal, there‚Äôll be transition time since there is no team. There‚Äôs no one to replace me on my team, unfortunately.However, the new role comes with a promotion and a 20% salary increase, so this is truly the best Christmas gift ever! The projects won‚Äôt be as interesting, but I want to take a break from LLMs and stick to classification. LLMs in a corporation is really‚Ä¶ political and the data sucks.And then I can look for a new role externally with the title change, so definitely excited! I definitely have imposter syndrome about the new role, but very excited to start having more than 4 hours of sleep and not waking up to a million rude messages from my manager. It‚Äôs ridiculously hard to prepare for a new job when your current job is so toxic and you‚Äôre so burnt out.Thanks so much for the advice and encouragement!!"
t3_18ngsgv,How to correctly use sklearn Transformers in a Pipeline,31,94,qtalen,t2_9r8ft2a0,0,self.datascience,"This article will explain how to use Pipeline and Transformers correctly in Scikit-Learn (sklearn) projects to speed up and reuse our model training process.This piece complements and clarifies the official documentation on Pipeline examples and some common misunderstandings.I hope that after reading this, you'll be able to use the Pipeline, an excellent design, to better complete your machine learning tasks.This article was originally published on my personal blog Data Leads Future.Why use a PipelineAs mentioned earlier, in a machine learning task, we often need to use various Transformers for data scaling and feature dimensionality reduction before training a model.This presents several challenges:Code complexity: For each use of a Transformer, we have to go through initialization, fit_transform, and transform steps. Missing one step during a transformation could derail the entire training process.Scikit-Learn introduced the Pipeline module to solve these issues."
t3_18nfk9b,Taking a Director of Data Science Position from First Company,15,7,dsthrowaway1337,t2_q91gszwod,0,self.datascience,"Hey data science people,I've been a data scientist now for several years, and am currently in somewhat of a leadership position. I work for a smaller company, for which I was their very first data scientist. Overall, I'd describe my situation as somewhat of a massive double-edged sword. I've developed all their infrastructure and have really set the scope of data science at the organization. This last year, I started a push into actual data products. In that sense, it's been very rewarding getting to experience multiple hats, mostly be my own boss, and to be able to create something across not only the modeling side, but also the infrastructure and product management sides.That said, the other side of the sword is all that comes with being the first data scientist at a smaller organization. The being a one-man startup within a company thing can definitely be a fair amount of exhausting and isolating. Hiring other positions itself has been very tricky. Company buy-in has been a weird mix... they definitely make me feel heavily valued, and I'm not afraid of losing my job. The last presentation I gave, the COO was practically salivating. Yet, I also feel like they haven't committed too much buy-in to data science in general. I've told my boss repeatedly how it all can feel really tenuous. Even scheduling meetings to go over data science success with various company stakeholders, feels like they really have to fit it in.With all that said, my boss has for a long time been very interested in scaling up data science at the organization. He recently informally offered me a title bump up to Director of Data Science, and I'm considering it. I've also been thinking about changing companies to experience how others do it, or else taking somewhat of a sabbatical to think out the next stage of my life, what direction I want to go in. Overall I'm torn about the limitations of my current company... had originally gotten into data science to do NLP, and now that LLMs are taking off, I feel like I'm falling farther and farther away from that working here. I'm also wondering on whether it would be smart to take on a director role from the first company I started my ds career with. I'm a little worried I would get shoehorned from now on into director roles, when I'm not sure I'm ready to give up a more raw position. That said, my company has overall treated me well, and it IS a director role, which essentially I'm already doing.So yeah, overall I think taking the director role would be an interesting experience and might play into my underlying motivations around creativity, BUT I'm also wary of the limitations of my own company in the field, and whether it overall aligns with my interests in things like LLMs.What do you guys think? :)"
